This is a [mono-repository/multi-package](https://dev.to/tallyb/six-blind-people-and-a-monorepo-1n49) built with Lerna & TypeScript.


## Contents

1. [bytes-to-co2:](./packages/bytes-to-co2) A library that estimates the CO2 released to the atmosphere based on the transferred byte size.
2. [co2-extension](./packages/co2-extension): A Chrome (for now) that shows the amount of CO2 released by visiting the current page.
3. [lighthouse-plugin-co2](./packages/lighthouse-plugin-co2): A Lighthouse Plugin that calculates the CO2 of all the data transferred by a page.
4. [co2-data](./packages/co2-data): A small library with information of carbon intensities by country.
